# Python bivittatus

**Do not use for illegal purposes.** Ensure that you have written consent and safe harbor before using against any network, host, or application. You can find much better, well-tested tools packaged in distributions such as [Kali Linux](https://www.kali.org/) or [Parrot OS](https://parrotlinux.org/), or in projects such as [PTF](https://github.com/trustedsec/ptf).

This project is solely for me to understand how security tools work under the hood and to build up my abilities to customize offensive tools without relying entirely on prefabricated ones. That being said, I have not tested these tools outside of networks and devices that I own, and cannot anticipate all of the consequences of using them on other systems. 

Although modified and greatly expanded, these programs are mostly derived from those in [Zaid Sabih's course on Udemy](https://www.udemy.com/course/learn-python-and-ethical-hacking-from-scratch/), as well as from the books [Black Hat Python](https://www.amazon.com/Black-Hat-Python-Programming-Pentesters/dp/1593275900) and [Violent Python](https://www.amazon.com/Violent-Python-Cookbook-Penetration-Engineers-ebook/dp/B00ABY67JS/ref=sr_1_1?dchild=1&keywords=violent+python&qid=1590676538&s=books&sr=1-1).
