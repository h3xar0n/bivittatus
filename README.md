# Python bivittatus

These are some Python programs I've created to help build up my offensive security skills. Although modified and greatly expanded, they are mostly derived from the programs in [Zaid Sabih's course on Udemy](https://www.udemy.com/course/learn-python-and-ethical-hacking-from-scratch/), as well as from the books [Black Hat Python](https://www.amazon.com/Black-Hat-Python-Programming-Pentesters/dp/1593275900) and [Violent Python](https://www.amazon.com/Violent-Python-Cookbook-Penetration-Engineers-ebook/dp/B00ABY67JS/ref=sr_1_1?dchild=1&keywords=violent+python&qid=1590676538&s=books&sr=1-1).
